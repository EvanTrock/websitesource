  bio:
    'I am currently a student at Staples High school and I am very interested in pursuing computer science, but more specifically data science and statistics in college. My passion for data science comes into play with my weekly radio show where I cite stats while entertaining fans with my sports analysis. Additionally, in my fantasy sports leagues, I grade players based on their stats and find great success due to my abilities. I have taken multiple summer courses to learn more about data science and I have taken AP statistics and AP computer science where I have gained experience coding in python and in Java. I also enjoy playing the violin and playing golf. At my school, I am the captain of the golf team, and I play in the chamber orchestra. Please review my GitHub and my recordings on this site.',
